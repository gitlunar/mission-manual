# Design Feedback Process

### In the design process:
* Project Owner + Design Lead make the final decision
* Feedback needs to be timely and specific
* Provide examples if possible
* Design Lead needs to create tasks in Asana with subtasks for each person that is needed to provide feedback
* No vague critique, that does not help anyone. Try to be as descriptive as possible.
